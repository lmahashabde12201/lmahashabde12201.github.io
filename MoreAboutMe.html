<p>I started my career working in automation tools for data processing and quickly gained expertise on the department process.  
   Being thorough and detail-oriented, I was responsible for documenting the department process that handled such requests.
</p>
<p>My customer focus and problem-solving attitude led me to take up a software consulting career where I worked for clients like 
   GE Electric AE, Atlanta Gas and Light and GE Capital onsite as well as offshore.  Observing the issues faced by customers onsite 
   and solving their problems helped me get a perspective while working offshore and delivering features.  I grew quickly into a 
   lead role where I was managing a 5-member offshore team. 
</p>
<p>I continued my software consulting career in healthcare services space in Maximus to understand the issues faced by California State 
   Dept. of Health Services in delivering services to their consumers and provide technology solutions through bug fixes and enhancements.
</p>
<p>With my experience in technology, client interactions and a passion for solving problems, I was ready to work for a product development 
   company and that is how I landed up with my job at Oracle.  I had a wonderful and broad experience working at Oracle wearing different 
   hats from software engineer to project and product manager.  As a Principal Applications Engineer, I had a 3-member offshore team and 
   was responsible for working with cross functional teams doing functional and technical architecture and delivering various features for 
   several products like Oracle Manufacturing Operations Center, Oracle Sustainability Sensor Data Management, Oracle Environmental Accounting 
   and Reporting and Oracle Pedigree and Serialization Manager.
</p>
<p>In my Product Management certification, I gained more PM experience working on a capstone project for Atlassian Confluence.
